# needlefinder 
Needlefinder is used to listen for UDP messages from WSJT-X and search for one or more
Maidenhead grid squares that were listed on the command line or were specified
by an entity or list of entities. When a match is found, the date and time along with 
the message are printed. Additionally the terminal bell is rung.
